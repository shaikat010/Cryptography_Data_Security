# Cryptography_Practise
Contains code for the cryptography practise coding. The codes contain cryptography codes for symmetric and asymmetric cryptography.

# What is Cryptography?
Cryptography is associated with the process of converting ordinary plain text into unintelligible text and vice-versa. It is a method of storing and transmitting data in a particular form so that only those for whom it is intended can read and process it. Cryptography not only protects data from theft or alteration, but can also be used for user authentication.

# What is cryptosystem?
The whole system whereby the encrypption and decryption occurs, the key configuration and all the algorithms combined is called the cryptosystem

# Types of cryptography
The 2 major types of cryptography are the public and private key cryptography. 

# Cryptalgorithms
There are several crypto algorithms or as they are generally called, cipher. There ar several known ciphers such as DES and AES and the RSA and DSA algorithms too. SOme of these cipher can been cracked and can no longer be in use due to security reasons while others are still being tested to be used in mass network data communication in the near future.
